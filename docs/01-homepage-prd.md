# Homepage PRD - Mumbai Ward Civic Engagement Platform

## Overview

The homepage serves as the entry point for Mumbai's premier civic engagement platform where citizens connect with their ward communities to report issues, organize events, discuss local matters, and drive neighborhood improvements. The platform requires ward boundary mapping as a prerequisite to enable location-based community features, but the core value is civic participation, not mapping itself.

### Technical Issues

- **Old browsers**: Graceful degradation, core functionality maintained

### Content Issues
- **No active wards near GPS location**: Show closest active communities with distance
- **Search returns no results**: Suggest similar area names, show browse option
- **User's ward inactive**: Clear explanation of mapping needed, call-to-action to help

### User Issues

- **Can't find their area**: Help text, alternative search methods, contact support
- **Multiple ward matches**: Show all options with current activity levels for easy choice

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Metrics
- **Bounce rate**: < 35% (users engage beyond initial page view)
- **Ward discovery success**: > 80% of users successfully find their ward
- **Community join rate**: > 30% of users who find their ward take action (register, report, discuss)
- **Return visits**: > 60% of registered users return within a week

### Community Growth
- **New user acquisition**: Steady growth in registered community members

### Accessibility
- **Screen readers**: Alt text for all images, semantic HTML structure
- **Keyboard navigation**: Tab order, keyboard shortcuts for map
- **Color contrast**: Sufficient contrast for ward status colors

### SEO
- **Meta tags**: Optimized for "Mumbai wards", "electoral boundaries"
- **Structured data**: Ward information, mapping progress
- **URLs**: Clean paths for ward pages (/ward/72, /ward/andheri-west)

### Analytics
- **User behavior**: Track discovery method preferences
- **Geographic data**: Where users are accessing from
- **Campaign progress**: Mapping completion rates over time
