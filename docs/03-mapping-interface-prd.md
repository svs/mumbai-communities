# Mapping Interface PRD - Mumbai Ward Civic Engagement Platform

## Overview

The mapping interface is the essential tool that enables civic engagement by creating ward boundary data that MCGM doesn't provide. This interface allows community members to trace ward boundaries from PDF maps, unlocking issue reporting, discussions, events, and community organizing for their neighborhood. While mapping is not the platform's primary purpose, it's the necessary foundation that makes location-based civic engagement possible.

## User Stories

### Primary Users
- **Ward residents** who want to unlock their community features so they can report issues and organize events
- **Civic activists** who want to help enable community organizing across multiple wards
- **Community builders** who understand that mapping unlocks neighborhood engagement tools
- **Local organizers** who need ward boundaries to facilitate area-specific discussions and meetups

### Core User Stories
- As a **ward resident**, I want to help map my ward so I can report local issues and connect with neighbors
- As a **community activist**, I want to map multiple wards so more neighborhoods can organize and advocate for improvements
- As a **new user**, I want the mapping process to be simple and clear so I can contribute without technical expertise
- As a **contributor**, I want to see my progress saved so I can complete mapping in multiple sessions if needed
- As a **community member**, I want to know my mapping work will directly enable civic engagement features

### Data Structure

#### Ward Mapping Session
- **Ward ID**: Which ward is being mapped
- **User ID**: Who is doing the mapping
- **Boundary Points**: Array of lat/lng coordinates
- **Status**: In progress, completed, submitted, verified
- **Created/Modified**: Timestamps for session tracking
- **PDF Reference**: Which MCGM PDF file being traced

#### Boundary Data
- **GeoJSON Format**: Standard geographic data format
- **Point Precision**: Sufficient detail for accurate boundaries
- **Validation Rules**: Closed polygon, minimum points, area constraints
- **Attribution**: Mapper credit and completion date

## User Flows

### New Mapper Flow
1. **Discover ward needs mapping** → From ward page or homepage
2. **Start mapping session** → Initialize interface with PDF overlay
3. **Learn basic controls** → Interactive tutorial or help tips
4. **Begin tracing** → Click around boundary following PDF guide
5. **Save progress** → Automatic saves, option for manual save
6. **Complete boundary** → Close polygon when full outline traced
7. **Review and submit** → Final check before verification submission
8. **Receive confirmation** → Email and on-screen success message

### Experienced Mapper Flow
1. **Choose ward to map** → From ward list or map interface
2. **Quick setup** → Familiar interface loads with preferred settings
3. **Efficient tracing** → Fast boundary creation with keyboard shortcuts
4. **Quality check** → Review boundary accuracy before submission
5. **Submit immediately** → Streamlined submission process
6. **Map next ward** → Continue to help unlock more communities

### Interrupted Session Flow
1. **Start mapping** → Begin tracing boundary
2. **Interruption** → Browser close, navigation away, or deliberate save
3. **Return to mapping** → Resume option presented clearly
4. **Continue work** → All progress preserved, continue from last point
5. **Complete or save again** → Finish mapping or save for later

## Edge Cases

### Technical Issues
- **PDF loading failure**: Provide alternative PDF source or manual reload
- **GPS unavailable**: Show general area but continue with mapping capability
- **Browser compatibility**: Graceful degradation for older browsers
- **Network interruption**: Local storage backup with sync on reconnection

### User Experience Issues
- **Accidental boundary deletion**: Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- **Complex ward shapes**: Additional help for difficult boundaries
- **PDF quality problems**: Instructions for handling unclear boundary lines
- **Precision concerns**: Guidance on acceptable accuracy levels

### Data Quality Issues
- **Incomplete boundaries**: Validation to ensure closed polygons
- **Overlapping wards**: Detection and resolution of boundary conflicts
- **Accuracy verification**: Process for handling mapping errors
- **Multiple submissions**: Handle duplicate mapping attempts gracefully

## Success Metrics

### Completion Metrics
- **Mapping success rate**: % of started sessions that complete (target: >70%)
- **Time to completion**: Average time to map a ward (target: <45 minutes)
- **User return rate**: Mappers who help with multiple wards (target: >40%)
- **Accuracy rate**: Boundaries approved without correction (target: >85%)

### Engagement Metrics
- **Session completion**: Users who finish vs abandon mapping (target: >60%)
- **Help system usage**: How often users access guidance
- **Mobile completion**: Success rate on mobile vs desktop devices
- **User satisfaction**: Post-mapping survey responses

### Community Impact
- **Ward unlock rate**: How quickly mapped wards become active communities
- **Attribution appreciation**: User satisfaction with mapping credit
- **Referral activity**: Mappers encouraging others to help
- **Cross-ward contribution**: Users mapping beyond their own ward

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements
- **PDF rendering**: Fast overlay display without blocking interface
- **Real-time drawing**: Responsive polygon creation without lag
- **Data persistence**: Reliable save/resume functionality
- **Mobile optimization**: Acceptable performance on older devices

### Integration Points
- **Google Maps API**: Base layer mapping and geocoding services
- **PDF Management**: Storage and serving of MCGM boundary documents
- **User Authentication**: Session management and attribution tracking
- **Verification System**: Integration with admin approval workflow

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full interface accessible via keyboard
- **Screen reader support**: Alternative descriptions for visual elements
- **Color contrast**: Sufficient visibility for boundary lines and controls
- **Touch accessibility**: Large enough touch targets for mobile users

### Data Security
- **User privacy**: No personal location tracking beyond necessary mapping
- **Session security**: Protection against unauthorized access to mapping sessions
- **Data validation**: Server-side verification of submitted boundaries
- **Backup systems**: Protection against data loss during mapping sessions

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Basic PDF overlay with simple click-to-trace functionality
- Essential controls: undo, clear, save, submit
- Email notification on completion
- Admin verification workflow

### Phase 2 (Enhanced Experience)
- Advanced drawing tools and precision controls
- Real-time collaboration features
- Improved mobile experience
- Community verification options

### Phase 3 (Scale & Automation)
- AI-assisted boundary detection
- Advanced quality control systems
- Bulk mapping tools for power users
- Integration with official MCGM systems

### Success Definition
The mapping interface succeeds when:
1. **All 227 wards are mapped** within reasonable timeframe
2. **Users understand** mapping enables community features
3. **Quality is maintained** with accurate, usable boundaries
4. **Community activation** follows quickly after mapping completion
5. **User experience** is smooth enough to encourage multi-ward contributions
