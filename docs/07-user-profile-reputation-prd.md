## Edge Cases

### Gaming and Abuse Prevention
- **Point farming**: Detection algorithms for artificial reputation inflation
- **Sock puppet accounts**: IP tracking and behavior analysis to prevent multi-account abuse
- **Vote manipulation**: Community voting patterns analysis to detect coordinated manipulation
- **Badge hunting**: Balance between achievement recognition and quality contribution

### Community Dynamics Issues
- **Popular user bias**: Ensure new voices can gain recognition alongside established contributors
- **Ward favoritism**: Prevent reputation advantages for users in more active wards
- **Personality conflicts**: Separate personal disputes from reputation assessment
- **Burnout prevention**: Avoid creating unsustainable pressure for constant contribution

### Technical and Privacy Concerns
- **Data portability**: Allow users to export their contribution history
- **Privacy protection**: Granular controls over profile information visibility
- **System manipulation**: Regular algorithm updates to prevent gaming
- **Cross-ward coordination**: Handle users who move between wards

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- **Profile completion**: Percentage of users with complete profiles (target: >70%)

### Community Quality
- **Contribution accuracy**: Verified vs. total submissions across trust levels (target: >85% for Level 3+)
- **Peer endorsements**: Users receiving community recognition (target: >50% have endorsements)
- **Mentorship success**: New users helped by higher-level users (target: >30% receive mentorship)
- **Leadership development**: Level 4+ users taking moderation roles (target: >60% active moderators)

### Platform Health
- **Reputation distribution**: Balanced representation across trust levels
- **Quality improvement**: Better content quality from higher-reputation users (measurable)
- **Community self-governance**: Reduced need for administrative intervention
- **User retention**: Higher retention rates for users with established reputation

## Technical Considerations

### Algorithm Fairness
- **Bias prevention**: Regular auditing of reputation algorithm for demographic fairness
