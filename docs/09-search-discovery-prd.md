## Edge Cases

### Search Quality Issues
- **No results found**: Helpful suggestions for alternative searches and related content
- **Too many results**: Smart filtering and pagination to manage overwhelming responses
- **Irrelevant results**: Machine learning feedback loop to improve ranking algorithms
- **Outdated content**: Clear temporal indicators and relevance decay for old content

### Technical Performance Issues
- **Slow search response**: Caching strategies and progressive result loading
- **High query volume**: Load balancing and search infrastructure scaling
- **Index inconsistency**: Real-time indexing and data synchronization processes
- **Mobile performance**: Optimized mobile search interface and reduced data usage

### User Experience Challenges
- **Search skill variation**: Progressive disclosure from simple to advanced search options
- **Language barriers**: Multilingual search support and translation integration
- **Overwhelming options**: Guided discovery and curated recommendation systems
- **Privacy concerns**: Granular privacy controls for search history and recommendations

## Success Metrics

### Search Effectiveness
- **Search success rate**: Queries resulting in user engagement with results (target: >80%)
- **Result relevance**: User satisfaction with search result quality (target: >4.0/5.0)
- **Zero-result rate**: Searches returning no results (target: <10%)
- **Search refinement rate**: Users modifying search after initial results (target: <30%)

### Discovery Impact
- **Content discoverability**: Percentage of platform content accessed through search (target: >60%)
- **Cross-ward discovery**: Users finding content outside their primary ward (target: >40%)
- **Trending accuracy**: Trending topics matching actual community engagement (target: >85%)

- **Advanced search usage**: Users utilizing filter and advanced options (target: >20%)
- **Saved search adoption**: Users saving searches for ongoing monitoring (target: >15%)
- **Discovery-to-action**: Search sessions leading to concrete actions (target: >35%)

## Technical Considerations

### Search Infrastructure
- **Search engine**: Elasticsearch or similar for full-text search and analytics
