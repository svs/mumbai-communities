# Prabhag Page PRD - Mumbai Ward Civic Engagement Platform

## Overview

The Prabhag page is the hyperlocal community hub for each subdivision (prabhag) within Mumbai's 227 electoral wards. It evolves from a simple "help map this prabhag" call-to-action to a comprehensive neighborhood engagement platform once boundaries are traced. This page serves as the primary interface for prabhag-specific issue tracking, community building, and hyperlocal civic participation within the broader ward context.

## User Stories

- **New residents** want to learn about their specific neighborhood's character, issues, and immediate community

## Edge Cases

### Mapping and Boundaries
- **Disputed boundaries**: Handle cases where residents disagree on prabhag limits
- **Multiple mappers**: Prevent conflicts when multiple users trace same prabhag simultaneously
- **Incomplete submissions**: What to show if mapping is abandoned partway through
- **Verification delays**: User expectations during boundary review process

### Community Management
- **Low activity**: Encourage engagement in quiet prabhags without overwhelming notifications
- **High volume**: Manage very active prabhags with lots of issues and discussions
- **Neighbor disputes**: Handle conflicts between residents in hyperlocal discussions
- **Privacy concerns**: Balance community building with resident privacy expectations

### Content and Quality
- **Spam/inappropriate content**: Handle fake issues or inappropriate neighborhood discussions
- **Location precision**: Verify reported issues are actually within prabhag boundaries
- **Duplicate issues**: Merge similar problems reported by multiple neighbors
- **Representative absence**: What to show if no local contact information available

## Success Metrics

### Community Engagement
- **Issue reports per prabhag**: Hyperlocal problem identification (target: > 1 per week for active prabhags)
- **Neighbor participation**: Comments, votes, and discussion engagement by residents
- **Event organization**: Community-initiated activities and attendance rates
- **Resolution efficiency**: Time from issue report to resolution (target: < 5 days for simple issues)

### Quality and Trust
- **Issue verification**: Community confirmation of problems and resolutions
- **Photo documentation**: Visual evidence of issues and improvements
- **Response accuracy**: How often issues are correctly categorized and located
- **Community moderation**: Resident self-policing and content quality maintenance

### Growth and Retention
- **Active neighbors**: Regular contributors to prabhag community (target: > 10% of estimated population)
- **Return visits**: Residents checking for updates (target: > 2 visits per week)
- **Cross-prabhag engagement**: Residents participating in nearby neighborhoods
- **Representative engagement**: Official responses to hyperlocal issues

## Technical Considerations

### Performance and Scale
- **Granular caching**: Prabhag content cached separately from ward-level data
- **Lazy loading**: Issues and discussions load as needed with infinite scroll
- **Location indexing**: Efficient spatial queries for hyperlocal issue mapping
- **Real-time updates**: Live notifications for immediate neighbors

### Mobile-First Design
- **Location detection**: GPS integration for precise issue reporting
- **Camera integration**: Direct photo capture with location tagging
- **Offline capability**: Core prabhag info and recently viewed issues available offline
- **Push notifications**: Hyperlocal alerts for immediate neighborhood

### Privacy and Safety
- **Location privacy**: Street-level precision without exact addresses
- **Neighbor anonymity**: Option to participate without revealing identity
- **Content moderation**: Community flagging plus automated filtering
- **Data protection**: Hyperlocal information secured appropriately
